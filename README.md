# Kitten Game

Kitten Game is a very simple experiment to develop a 2D game using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Introduction

The main scene of the game shows a kitten inside a rectangular area bounded by a wall, with no way out.  
The kitten can be moved in all eight directions using the cursor keys.  
The game also includes a nice background music.

The source code of the project covers in a very simple way some concepts on game development, such as:

- Sprites
- Tilemaps
- Movements
- Collisions
- Cameras
- Audio playing

## [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a open-source visual IDE to develop multi-platform 2D and 3D games using built-in scripts in python like language.  
It supports deployment to multiple platforms like:

- **desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Universal Windows Platform (UWP), *BSD
- **mobile**: iOS, Android
- **consoles**: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One (via third-party providers)
